# Arcadian Developer Mantra ðŸ“œ
This document is not exhaustive and is not intended to be followed to the letter, these are a series of "rules" that we like to use when reminding ourselves to keep solutions simple and to the point, with that being said let's get started. ðŸš€

### Code Goals â˜„

This is heavily inspired by [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and [The Best Code is No Code At All](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/).

- ðŸ“š Readability is important
- ðŸ‘Œ Be explicit not implicit
- ðŸ›‘ Do not write code you don't need
- ðŸ¤” If it feels too complicated it probably is
- ðŸ’© Do not account for features you don't have
- ðŸš‘ Refactor when needed, not if it might be needed later

The essence of the message is this, the less code there is the less chance there is for things to go wrong, developers are inherently forward thinking and want to build the product that can do it all, it's better to do one thing well than many things poorly.
